## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:

# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79

# a = 60
# b = 58
# c = 98
# d = 79
# total = a + b + c + d
# ave = total / 4
# print ( ave )

# put all the numbers into 4 variables (e.g. a = 60 b = 58...)
#add all the variables together (a + b + c...)
#divide the total by 4
# print the answer


# find out the remainder of two number in division
# creating two variables num1 and num2 to find out the remainder of num1/num2
# print out the remainder
# num1 = 57
# num2 = 2
# print (num1%num2)


## Task 3: Rounding practice

# **Task 3a**:
# Round 42.56789 to two decimal places.

# **Task 3b**:
# Round 1267.15 to the nearest integer.

# **Task 3c**:
# Round 1785.956 to the nearest hundreds.

# print(round(42.56789,2))
# print(round(1267.15,0))
# print(round(1785.956,-2))

## Task 4: Mathematics with variables
# For each of the following questions, create variables to hold
# the values given before finally using print(ans) to print the
# answer:

# **Task 4a**:
# Create 2 variables 'a' and 'b', assign any number to
# them and print their sum.

# **Task 4b**:
# Subtract 10 from 50, then multiply the result by 3.

# **Task 4c**:
# Divide 100 by 4 and print the result.

# **Task 4d**:
# Calculate and print the result of (3 + 4) * 5 - (10 / 2).

## Task 5: Order of Operations practice
# Code one Python expression to calculate and print the total cost for each task. Round the answer to 2 decimal places.

# **Task 5a**:
# - Two boxes of pineapple tarts - $15 each
# - One packet of bak kwa for - $58

# **Task 5b**:
# A 10% service charge is applied, and a $25 off voucher is used, to the following order:
# - One seafood platter - $96
# - Three side dishes - $18 each
# - Six bowls of rice - $2 each

# **Task 5c**:
# A 10% service charge is applied then, a 9% GST is applied, to the following order:
# - Five seafood platters - $100 each
# - Eight side dishes - $20 each
# - Twenty bowls of rice - $2.50 each

#Task 5a
print(15*2+58)

#Task 5b
print(round((96+18*3+2*6)*1.1-25,2))

#Task 5c
print(round((500+160+20*2.5)*1.1*1.09,2))

number = input("What is your favourite number?\n")
print(number)
